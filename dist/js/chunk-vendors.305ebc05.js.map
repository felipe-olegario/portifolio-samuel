See {constructor} for an example on creating a credentials\n * object with proper `RoleArn` and `WebIdentityToken` values.\n *\n * ## Refreshing Credentials from Identity Service\n *\n * In addition to AWS credentials expiring after a given amount of time, the\n * login token from the identity provider will also expire. Once this token\n * expires, it will not be usable to refresh AWS credentials, and another\n * token will be needed. The SDK does not manage refreshing of the token value,\n * but this can be done through a \"refresh token\" supported by most identity\n * providers. Consult the documentation for the identity provider for refreshing\n * tokens. Once the refreshed token is acquired, you should make sure to update\n * this new token in the credentials object's {params} property. The following\n * code will update the WebIdentityToken, assuming you have retrieved an updated\n * token from the identity provider:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials.params.WebIdentityToken = updatedToken;\n * ```\n *\n * Future calls to `credentials.refresh()` will now use the new token.\n *\n * @!attribute params\n *   @return [map] the map of params passed to\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}. To update the token, set the\n *     `params.WebIdentityToken` property.\n * @!attribute data\n *   @return [map] the raw data response from the call to\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}. Use this if you want to get\n *     access to other properties from the response.\n */\nAWS.WebIdentityCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new credentials object.\n   * @param (see AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity)\n   * @example Creating a new credentials object\n   *   AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.WebIdentityCredentials({\n   *     RoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/WebIdentity',\n   *     WebIdentityToken: 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP', // token from identity service\n   *     RoleSessionName: 'web' // optional name, defaults to web-identity\n   *   }, {\n   *     // optionally provide configuration to apply to the underlying AWS.STS service client\n   *     // if configuration is not provided, then configuration will be pulled from AWS.config\n   *\n   *     // specify timeout options\n   *     httpOptions: {\n   *       timeout: 100\n   *     }\n   *   });\n   * @see AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n   * @see AWS.Config\n   */\n  constructor: function WebIdentityCredentials(params, clientConfig) {\n    AWS.Credentials.call(this);\n    this.expired = true;\n    this.params = params;\n    this.params.RoleSessionName = this.params.RoleSessionName || 'web-identity';\n    this.data = null;\n    this._clientConfig = AWS.util.copy(clientConfig || {});\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Refreshes credentials using {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}\n   *\n   * @callback callback function(err)\n   *   Called when the STS service responds (or fails).

Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(error, response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.

Cognito Identity service.\n *\n * By default this provider gets credentials using the\n * {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getCredentialsForIdentity} service operation, which\n * requires either an `IdentityId` or an `IdentityPoolId` (Amazon Cognito\n * Identity Pool ID), which is used to call {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getId} to\n * obtain an `IdentityId`. If the identity or identity pool is not configured in\n * the Amazon Cognito Console to use IAM roles with the appropriate permissions,\n * then additionally a `RoleArn` is required containing the ARN of the IAM trust\n * policy for the Amazon Cognito role that the user will log into. If a `RoleArn`\n * is provided, then this provider gets credentials using the\n * {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity} service operation, after first getting an\n * Open ID token from {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken}.\n *\n * In addition, if this credential provider is used to provide authenticated\n * login, the `Logins` map may be set to the tokens provided by the respective\n * identity providers. See {constructor} for an example on creating a credentials\n * object with proper property values.\n *\n * ## Refreshing Credentials from Identity Service\n *\n * In addition to AWS credentials expiring after a given amount of time, the\n * login token from the identity provider will also expire. Once this token\n * expires, it will not be usable to refresh AWS credentials, and another\n * token will be needed. The SDK does not manage refreshing of the token value,\n * but this can be done through a \"refresh token\" supported by most identity\n * providers. Consult the documentation for the identity provider for refreshing\n * tokens. Once the refreshed token is acquired, you should make sure to update\n * this new token in the credentials object's {params} property. The following\n * code will update the WebIdentityToken, assuming you have retrieved an updated\n * token from the identity provider:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials.params.Logins['graph.facebook.com'] = updatedToken;\n * ```\n *\n * Future calls to `credentials.refresh()` will now use the new token.\n *\n * @!attribute params\n *   @return [map] the map of params passed to\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getId},\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken}, and\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}.

See {AWS.S3.ManagedUpload~httpUploadProgress} for more\n * information.\n *\n * ## Handling Multipart Cleanup\n *\n * By default, this class will automatically clean up any multipart uploads\n * when an individual part upload fails. This behavior can be disabled in order\n * to manually handle failures by setting the `leavePartsOnError` configuration\n * option to `true` when initializing the upload object.\n *\n * @!event httpUploadProgress(progress)\n *   Triggered when the uploader has uploaded more data.\n *   @note The `total` property may not be set if the stream being uploaded has\n *     not yet finished chunking. In this case the `total` will be undefined\n *     until the total stream size is known.\n *   @note This event will not be emitted in Node.js 0.8.x.\n *   @param progress [map] An object containing the `loaded` and `total` bytes\n *     of the request and the `key` of the S3 object. Note that `total` may be undefined until the payload\n *     size is known.\n *   @context (see AWS.Request~send)\n */\nAWS.S3.ManagedUpload = AWS.util.inherit({\n  /**\n   * Creates a managed upload object with a set of configuration options.\n   *\n   * @note A \"Body\" parameter is required to be set prior to calling {send}.\n   * @note In Node.js, sending \"Body\" as {https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode object-mode stream}\n   *   may result in upload hangs.

Creating the service\n * instance during instantiation effectively captures the master credentials\n * from the global config, so that subsequent changes to the global config do\n * not affect the master credentials used to refresh the temporary credentials.\n *\n * This allows an instance of AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials to be assigned\n * to AWS.config.credentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var envCreds = new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS');\n * AWS.config.credentials = envCreds;\n * // masterCredentials will be envCreds\n * AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Similarly, to use the CredentialProviderChain's default providers as the\n * master credentials, simply create a new instance of\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials = new ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @!attribute service\n *   @return [AWS.STS] the STS service instance used to\n *     get and refresh temporary credentials from AWS STS.\n * @note (see constructor)\n */\nAWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new temporary credentials object.\n   *\n   * @param options [map] a set of options\n   * @option options params [map] ({}) a map of options that are passed to the\n   *   {AWS.STS.assumeRole} or {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operations.\n   *   If a `RoleArn` parameter is passed in, credentials will be based on the\n   *   IAM role.

{sessionToken}.\n * Creating a `Credentials` object allows you to pass around your\n * security information to configuration and service objects.\n *\n * Note that this class typically does not need to be constructed manually,\n * as the {AWS.Config} and {AWS.Service} classes both accept simple\n * options hashes with the three keys. These structures will be converted\n * into Credentials objects automatically.\n *\n * ## Expiring and Refreshing Credentials\n *\n * Occasionally credentials can expire in the middle of a long-running\n * application. In this case, the SDK will automatically attempt to\n * refresh the credentials from the storage location if the Credentials\n * class implements the {refresh} method.\n *\n * If you are implementing a credential storage location, you\n * will want to create a subclass of the `Credentials` class and\n * override the {refresh} method.
